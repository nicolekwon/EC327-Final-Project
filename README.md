# EC327-Final-Project
KAYND is a team consisting of Yan Chen (ychen01@bu.edu), Kathleen Wong (kleencw@bu.edu), Nicole Kwon (kwonn@bu.edu), Austin Negron (negrona@bu.edu), and Daniel Shimon (dshimon@bu.edu). This repository is to create an Android app that acts as an online marketplace for specifically Boston University students where they can buy, rent, and sell their textbooks. This app will be useful because the digital age is currently happening; there is an ever-growing reliance and increase of technology use such as e-commerce.

In order to build the project, you must open an existing project created (the TerrierExchange folder containing app, res, etc.) on Android Studio. Then, you should download an emulator (we used the Pixel 2 or Pixel 3 API 29) to run the app. Once this is made possible and the project is synced with the gradle files, you should be able to run the app. If the app did not automatically open up, you can do so by finding the Terrier Exchange app (yellow with a "TX" label) on the emulator. Once this is done, you will be directed to a login page, and you should first register an account.
